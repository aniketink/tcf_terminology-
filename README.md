## Features

-   **Modern User Interface**: Built with `CustomTkinter` for a clean, professional look that supports both **Light and Dark modes**.
-   **Authoritative Definitions**: Utilizes a hybrid search strategy for the best results:
    1.  **Primary Source**: First queries the **MedlinePlus API** from the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) for authoritative medical definitions.
    2.  **Fallback Source**: If no definition is found, it seamlessly falls back to **Wikipedia** for broader coverage.
-   **Intelligent Autocomplete**: Suggests relevant medical terms as you type, helping you find information faster and more accurately. The suggestions are powered by a curated corpus of cancer-related terms.
-   **Responsive & Non-Blocking**: The application uses `threading` to perform network requests in the background, ensuring the UI never freezes while searching for a term.
-   **Smart Text Cleaning**: Definitions from APIs are often returned in messy HTML format. The application uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse and clean this data, presenting only readable, well-formatted text to the user.
